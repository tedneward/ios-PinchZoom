# ios-PinchZoom
An exploration of gesture recognizers

Pinch/zoom makes the center label bigger/smaller (in fixed chunks)
Rotation makes the center label rotate
Hit one of the four buttons to turn on left/right/up/down gesture recognizers; recognizing the gesture lowercases the label
Tap displays the tap result in the bottom label. (Which should be word-wrapped, but isn't for some reason. Bug.)
